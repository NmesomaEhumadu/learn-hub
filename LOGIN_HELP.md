# Login & Dashboard Explanation

## 🔍 Where is my Login Page?
Your Login page code is **safe** and has not been removed. It is located at:
`src/pages/Login.tsx`

## 🧭 Why do I see "Dashboard" on the Index Page?
You are currently **Logged In** as a user (Teacher or Student).
When you are logged in, the Navigation Bar automatically changes the "Login" button to a "Dashboard" button. This is a standard feature to help you access your account easily.

## 🔓 How to see the Login button again?
1.  Click on the **Dashboard** button (or go to `/dashboard`).
2.  Click the **Log Out** icon (usually a door icon) in the header.
3.  You will be logged out, and the **Login** button will reappear in the Navigation bar.

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied
I have also fixed the issue where the screen was frozen ("can't press anything").
-   I removed the blocking background effects from the Login, Dashboard, and Course Details pages.
-   You should now be able to scroll and click buttons normally.

## 🚀 Try it now
1.  Refresh your page.
2.  If you want to test the Login page, please **Log Out** first.
